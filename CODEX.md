# CODEX Review of crosstache

## Overview
`crosstache` is a Rust-based CLI for Azure Key Vault management. The `README.md` outlines features such as full secret management, group organization using tags, vault operations, RBAC access control, and bulk import/export capabilities.

## Observations
- The current codebase already includes a vault context system. The `ContextManager` in `src/config/context.rs` loads local or global context files and tracks recent vault usage.
- Secret commands (`execute_secret_set`, `execute_secret_update`, etc.) rely on context resolution and use `rpassword` for interactive input or read from stdin when the `--stdin` flag is passed.
- The `Init` command in `src/cli/commands.rs` is a stub and does not yet implement interactive setup.
- Tests fail to compile because the linker cannot find XCB libraries, likely due to missing system dependencies.

## Recommendations Based on IMPROVE.md
1. **Interactive Setup**: Implement the proposed `xv init` wizard to simplify first‑time configuration. Auto-detect Azure CLI credentials and subscription as described.
2. **Smart Vault Context Detection**: Continue improving the context system. Add prompts or CLI feedback showing the active vault and provide easy switching between contexts.
3. **Improved Secret Input**: Add features like `--editor`, `--from-file`, and environment variable substitution to support complex secret values. A new `src/utils/input.rs` module (as suggested in `INPUT.md`) would encapsulate these input methods.
4. **Enhanced Secret Search**: Implement fuzzy search (`secret find`), tag-based filtering, and tree views to help users discover secrets more easily.
5. **Command Aliases**: Provide short aliases (`xv get`, `xv set`, etc.) to make frequent commands quicker to type.
6. **Consistent Output Formatting**: Standardize output options across commands and allow template-based formatting.
7. **Bulk Operations**: Extend secret operations with batch input and migration utilities for large-scale secret management.
8. **Better Error Messages**: Implement contextual suggestions when operations fail, as described under the error handling section.
9. **Developer Experience**: Offer shell completion scripts and possibly IDE integrations to streamline daily usage.

## Build/Test Status
Running `cargo test` fails with missing XCB libraries:
```
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
error: could not compile `crosstache` (bin "xv" test) due to 1 previous error
```
This indicates additional system packages are required for successful builds.

## Conclusion
The project shows solid progress toward a full-featured Azure Key Vault CLI. Implementing the high‑priority items from `IMPROVE.md`—interactive setup, smart context detection, and improved secret input—will greatly enhance usability. Addressing build issues and expanding test coverage will further stabilize the codebase.
